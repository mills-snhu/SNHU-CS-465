Full Stack Development

<b>Architecture:</b>

<b>Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).</b>

Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular was included in the development of this application. The SPA allows for a dynamic user experience with interactive applications. 

 The Express HTML uses Handlebars to render server-side dynamic content. 

<b>Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?</b>

The NoSQL MongoDB database was used to take advantage of MongoDb's scalibility and flexibility which allows a user to easily modify data into and out of the database. 


<b>Functionality:</b>

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.


<b>Testing:</b>

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
